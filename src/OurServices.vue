        <ServiceDescription imgSrc="waxing.jpg" title="Waxing" description="Waxing leaves the skin feeling soft, supple and rejuvenated by exfoliating and removing dead skin cells. 
        Every session results in finer, thinner, and softer hair growth as opposed to the coarse, thick strands that other options bring. Waxing removes hair from the root, 
        which allows for longer-lasting silky smoothness. The growth of hair varies and depends on the rate of...#br##br# individual hair growth. The average hair-free time would be for at least 1.5 to 2 weeks. 
        It is advisable to wax every 4-6 weeks for best results. Yes, waxing hurts, but the majority of women find it manageable. Aftercare tips: For 12 to 24 hours, avoid hot baths, tanning, swimming, deodorants, and abrasions (such wearing tight jeans).
        Apply tea tree lotion as an antiseptic after waxing to prevent inflammation and rashes, and regularly to clean the pores to avoid ingrown hairs. After 5-7 days of waxing, gently exfoliate the region to remove dead skin that might lead to buried hairs or 
        ingrowns."></ServiceDescription>
